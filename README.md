# WeatherApp
I created this app using React Native Expo. I learned a lot of new thing while making this application like how the styled components works
How to use chatgpt efficiently to implement own features and when you found the depreaceted(which are no longer in use) methods so how to 
learn from documentations and search the alternatives. I also added the feature of exit the keyword when you enter on anywhere on the screen without entering any message.

## Introduction
WeatherApp is a simple application that provides weather updates for different locations. It fetches data from a weather API and displays the current weather conditions, forecast, and other relevant information.

## Features
- Asked to allow location from user
- Show the weather report of current location
- The Best thing I Hide the API key ðŸ˜…, So no one can copy my free API
- Config the API in .env file.
- Search and Find the location and check the weather
- User-friendly interface

## Unique Features Added By Me

- When you press enter it will search the entered input
- Work on the case sensitivity
